            <p>Sorted is India’s first (and possibly the world’s first) entirely grain-free and naturally sweetened lifestyle deli. Sorted. Delicatessen is the brainchild of Girish Monie. Sorted. Delicatessen’s endeavor is to change the way people eat, by indulging them with food such as burgers, pizzas, wraps, and sandwiches made tasty and healthy. There are no grains, wheat, corn, soy, or rice used in the kitchen, nor are there any preservatives, chemicals, refined oil/food, additives, bleach, or food colorings. Sorted. Delicatessen’s food is nutrient-dense, full of fiber, ‘good for you’ fats, carbs, proteins, superfoods, whole foods, and real foods.</p>
            <p>The journey to get Sorted. began with the usual concerns about health, particularly healthy eating. Having lived all around the world and traveled extensively, adding more than just stamps to his passport, Girish Monie felt the need to practice a more wholesome lifestyle of healthy eating. Girish launch the Sorted. Delicatessen project post two years of thorough research in a test kitchen, with a strong emphasis on the brand’s grain-free, naturally sweetened aspects. Corporate Chef Ubeid Khan collaborated with Girish to develop recipes, combinations, and calculate the macronutrients of each dish as they worked towards their goal to get people Sorted.</p>
