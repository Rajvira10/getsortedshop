            <h1>Refund and Returns Policy</h1>
            <p>This Refund and Returns Policy shall only be applicable for products ordered directly via Sorted’s website.</p>
            <p>Here at Sorted, we constantly endeavour to the best of our ability and efforts to ensure that orders placed by Customers are correctly fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Given the nature of our items, we do not generally offer a refund or a credit on a purchase except in cases where the products ordered are not delivered as expected, or as required by law.</p>
            <p>In the event that you receive any product(s) and are not satisfied with it, you may be eligible for a return or exchange if you contact us within 24 hours of delivery. Please note that you will be eligible for a return or exchange only if the product does not meet Sorted’s standards. You would not be eligible for a refund for any reasons that are beyond the control of Sorted such as taste preference, not storing the product as instructed, or any other reason as decided by Sorted.</p>
            <p>To fulfil your fresh and frozen food requirements and deliveries, we do not entertain refunds in the form of cash but in the form of voucher or store credit only. Alternatively, we will arrange for any return and exchange of Product(s) with the same Product(s) that was ordered or other Product(s) provided the price difference would be paid for by the Customer.</p>
            <p>In case the customer wishes to cancel an order, Sorted will try to cancel the order but may not be able to do so depending on the status of the order (eg. if the order is already being processed, has been dispatched, or is in any state that cannot be canceled)</p>
